            <h2>Part One</h2>
            <p>Wasn't sure what to put here, and I didn't wanna go with the industry standard latin gibberish. So here's a fun fact! Did you know html and css are an absolute nightmare for certain types of people? I'm one of them!!!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Part Two (Unrelated)</h2>
            <p>I think this is best followed up with a second fun fact. Did you know at the Battle of Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce, of Braveheart fame, cut Sir Henry de Bohun's head in half with one swing of his axe! Allegedly, his only remark was "Hm, I broke my favorite axe!" This, however, would soon be the least of his problems.</p>
